Miguel's UNIX Kernel (Î¼nix)

**Credits:** The code for the kernel (only the kernel core and the ToaruOS image from the screenshot above (used only for testing purposes)) has been obtained through https://github.com/klange/toaruos, developed by Kevin Lange and his contributors. For this work I thank him and everyone who worked for Toaru kernel.

**Questions**
-------------
1) Some people might think the same of ToaruOS, so I'll answer the question: **Is this a Linux Distribution/Kernel?**

I'd agree that Kevin would answer the same way as me: **NO**. It was made by him and his contributors from scratch. No linux nor unix whatsoever.
